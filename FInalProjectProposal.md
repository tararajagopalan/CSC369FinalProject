Multiple data sources are involved in this project. 

Context: 

Part B: Drugs taken in a doctors office or hospital under medical supervision (shots, injections)

Part D: Drugs taken outside of a doctors office without medical supervision (medical prescription pills)

Potential Questions of Interest from Part B and D Quarterly Datasets ~ Quarter 2 for year 2025: 

- Which types of drugs (by Generic or Brand Name) does insurance tend to cover more money for? 
- Which types of drugs does insurance tend to cover less money for? Are their any specific drugs in which insurance pays an abnormally low amount, or an abnormally high amount? 

Potential Questions of Interest from part B and D annual datasets (latest data available for the year 2023, with records from 2019 through 2023 stored in the dataset): 

- Has insurance average spending per claim and insurance spending per beneficiary increased or decreased throughout the years? 

- How does the outlier flag impact the amount of money insurance claims spend? 

- Examine what the growth rate looks like for insurance companies spending money on dosage units. 

Potential Questions of Interest from part B Discarded Drug Units: 

- Is Medicare insurance covering a lot of money for discarded drugs (drugs not given to patient)?


Medicare, Physician, and Other Practitioners – By Provider and Service: 

- I can study trends in Medicare coverage by service in different locations. 

Overall Question I want to Answer using Potential Questions listed above: 

- Are there patients with specific kinds of drug usage that are not receiving as much insurance coverage from Medicare for their treatments as others? How can that issue be resolved? 
- How do Medicare coverage vary for different kinds of services in different locations? 



**2.Why is this question worth answering? This can be either because it has some personal value to you or because it is a question that others are asking. If it is a question others are asking, then provide an example.**

I posed this question from a personal standpoint. In my family, there has been a history of various health conditions, including cancer, heart problems, parkinsons disease, and skin conditions. These conditions require different medical treatments both under medical supervision (part B) and without medical supervision (part D). I am curious to see whether different categories of disease deal with different amounts of insurance coverage from Medicare. I can maybe do some external research on which types of conditions these drugs in the tables treat. 


**3.What is your hypothesis? Why leads you towards that hypothesis?**

My hypothesis is that insurance covers more money towards drugs that fall in the Part B category because they are administered under medical supervision, and factors such as discarded amount of drug and potential complications in drug administration could be accounted for. 


**4.	What is the primary dataset(s) you will use to answer the question? The dataset(s) must be at least 15GB in their original form when downloaded. Provide links. You may not choose r/place (any year) as your analysis set.**

In question 1, I wrote down questions that could potentially be answered by the different datasets, and when those questions are answered, perhaps a conclusion could be drawn together.
